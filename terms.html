        YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT THAT BINDS YOU IN THE SAME WAY THAT A PAPER CONTRACT BINDS YOU. THIS AGREEMENT LIMITS VISTAPRINT LIABILITY AND OBLIGATIONS TO YOU TO THE TERMS SET FORTH HEREIN AND PERMITS VISTAPRINT TO CHANGE, SUSPEND, OR TERMINATE YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES.

No license or right to use, reproduce, translate, rearrange, modify, enhance, display, sell, lease, sublicense or otherwise distribute, transfer or dispose of the Services accessed by You hereunder, in whole or in part, is granted except as expressly provided by this Agreement.

        4. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.
        You represent, warrant and covenant to VistaPrint that:
        
        No information or content delivered by You or any of Your affiliates to VistaPrint in support of this Agreement will infringe on any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or other proprietary right held by any third party.
        You will not use the Services in a manner that violates any law or regulation.

        5. EMAIL, PERMISSION PRACTICES, IMAGE HOSTING & PROHIBITED CONTENT.
        Subscriber Opt Out. Every email message transmitted by the Services must contain an "unsubscribe" link that allows subscribers to remove themselves from Your mailing list and a link to the then current VistaPrint Privacy Policy.

You shall monitor and process unsubscribe requests received by You directly within 10 days of submission, and update the email addresses to which messages are sent through Your VistaPrint account. You acknowledge that You are responsible for maintaining and honoring the list of unsubscribe requests following termination of Your account and this Agreement.
        Permission Practices. You agree to import, access or otherwise use only Permission Based Lists in connection with Your use of the Services.

If You have used any feature of the Services that allows You to request a recipient to confirm that You have his or her permission to send emails to him or her, and such recipient has not responded or does not respond affirmatively to such request for confirmation, You agree that You shall not send emails to that recipient. Without limiting the foregoing, You agree that You shall not utilize the Services to send any commercial electronic mail message to any person who has opted out or otherwise objected to receiving such messages from You or another sender on whose behalf You may be acting. You cannot mail to distribution lists, newsgroups, or spam or unsolicited email addresses.

VistaPrint, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether Your level of spam complaints is within industry norms, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes under this Agreement. VistaPrint will terminate Your use of its Services if VistaPrint determines that Your level of spam complaints is higher than industry norms.
        Spamming. You shall use the Services only in compliance with this Agreement, and all applicable laws and regulations related notably to spamming, privacy, obscenity, or defamation, copyright and trademark infringement and child protective email address registry laws).

        Footers. Unless you are a part of VistaPrint’s authorized reseller program, for every email message transmitted by the Services, You acknowledge and agree that VistaPrint may add an identifying footer stating "Email Marketing by VistaPrint," "Powered by VistaPrint" or a similar message.

Any other use of Your Marks shall be with Your prior written consent and subject to all written guidelines You provide regarding the use of Your Marks. By submitting ideas, concepts, inventions, or content to VistaPrint or using them in connection with the Services, You agree that such submission is non-confidential for all purposes.

If You make any submission to this web site or if You submit any business information, idea, concept or invention to VistaPrint by email, You automatically grant—or warrant that the owner of such content or intellectual property has expressly granted— VistaPrint a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, and display such content in any manner.
        
        VistaPrint does not claim ownership of the content that You provide to VistaPrint or through the Services, and VistaPrint acknowledges and agrees that, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You will retain any and all applicable copyright and other intellectual property rights in Your content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You hereby grant VistaPrint a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, unlimited, assignable, royalty-free, license to (i) copy, host, use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, improve, distribute, transmit, publish, remove, retain, add to, combine with information provided by third parties, and publicly display Your content (a) on and through the Services for the purpose of creating, operating and maintaining the Services and (b) in VistaPrint’s promotional and advertising materials for the limited purpose of promoting the Services, and (ii) sublicense to third parties Your content to the extent necessary for the creation, operation, and maintenance of, in part or in whole, the Services.

By submitting, posting, uploading, transmitting or otherwise making available any Your content or by posting messages, uploading files, inputting data, submitting any feedback or suggestions, or engaging in any other form of communication with or through the Services, You warrant and represent that You own or otherwise control the rights necessary to do so and to grant VistaPrint the license set forth above, and, pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 3, You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless VistaPrint and the other Indemnified Parties from any third party claim related to a breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties.
        
        9. DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY.
        VistaPrint utilizes reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to help VistaPrint protect against the loss, misuse, disclosure and alteration of any of Your content or data that VistaPrint receives from You and any personal data VistaPrint receives from You about Your end users or customers (“End-User Data”). With respect to certain services provided pursuant to this Agreement as part of the Services, VistaPrint may act as Your data processor with respect to such End-User Data, in which case, as detailed below, VistaPrint processes such End-User Data only in accordance with Your instructions. You are responsible for complying with all consumer protection and data privacy laws (including compliance with the duty of information to data subjects) with respect to such End-User Data, and will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless VistaPrint and each other Indemnified Party from and against any and all Liabilities incurred by an Indemnified Party arising out of or related to Your failure to so comply.
        
        Namely, VistaPrint shall fulfill the following obligations:
        
        1. Process End-User Data exclusively pursuant to Your instructions and shall not use End-User Data for any other purposes other than those expressly indicated in this Agreement.
        
        2. Not to disclose, transfer, assign or otherwise communicate to any third party the End-User Data, even for storage purposes, without Your previous authorization, save as required by law or set forth by administrative or judicial order.
        
        3. Implement and maintain the relevant security measures required under applicable regulations.
        
        4. Destroy or return to You (as indicated by You upon termination of the services) End-User Data, save as otherwise set forth by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing VistaPrint will keep End-User Data duly blocked to evidence effective compliance with contractual or legal duties during the statutes of limitation foreseen by applicable law.
        
        On the other hand, You guarantee to VistaPrint compliance with the provisions on personal data protection that are applicable to You as a data controller of End-User Data, including:
        
        1. The filing and, where applicable, the amendment of the files with the competent data protection authority.
        2. The implementation of security measures set forth by applicable regulations.
        
        3. The legitimate collection of End-User Data which is disclosed to VistaPrint for its processing, where applicable.
        
        4. End-User Data communicated to VistaPrint will be kept up to date, and is adequate, relevant and not excessive towards the concrete, specific and legitimate purpose for which it was collected.
        
        VistaPrint is authorized by You to subcontract all or part of its obligations under this Agreement to which end VistaPrint will enter into a data processing agreement with any subcontractors, which will set forth the same substantive obligations under this Clause. Pursuant to applicable data protection regulations, subcontractors will be considered as Your data processors and therefore shall follow Your instructions as regards the processing of End-User Data. However, You accept that said instructions may be directly transmitted to subcontractors by VistaPrint, and include all instructions necessary or appropriate to support the performance of this Agreement. VistaPrint shall provide You a copy of any data processing agreement entered into with its subcontractors upon written request. In addition, the parties agree that they hereby enter into the standard contractual clauses for data processors in third countries (2002/16/EC) (the “Model Processor Contract”), as issued by the European Commission, and as set forth in Attachment A to this Agreement, and that their respective signatures on this Agreement constitute their signatures on Attachment A.
        
        10. CHARGES AND BILLING.
        VistaPrint reserves the right to charge fees for the Services or any portion thereof and any applicable fees will be posted on the VistaPrint website. If You are required to pay a fee for all or any part of the Service for which You have chosen to subscribe, You hereby authorize VistaPrint to charge the designated valid financial account You provided to VistaPrint upon registration for the Services in advance for all applicable fees incurred by You in connection with Your account. Your account will automatically renew at the end of each applicable subscription period, unless Your account is terminated in advance of the end of the then-current subscription period. If there are any annual, monthly or similar periodic subscription fees associated with Your account, these fees will be billed automatically to Your designated valid financial account at the start of each renewal period, unless You terminate Your account before the relevant period begins. If You registered for the Services using a VistaPrint promotional code or discount, after the initial promotional period expires, Your subscription (base package and any purchased upgrades) will automatically be renewed and billing will continue at the then-current prices for the Services. You further acknowledge that it is Your responsibility to notify VistaPrint of any changes to Your valid designated financial account information, including, without limitation, updates to Your credit card number if Your credit card has expired, or Your account and access to the Services may be terminated or interrupted.
        
        VistaPrint reserves the right to change any fees (which includes but is not limited to, increasing prices on existing or new services and charging a fee for upgrades and/or a service for which VistaPrint does not currently charge a fee) at any time and from time to time, provided, however, that VistaPrint will provide You with reasonable notice prior to making any fee changes to existing the Services. If You find any change to the pricing of the Services to be unacceptable for Your continued use of the Services, You are free to cancel the Services and terminate Your account at any time, but VistaPrint will not be obligated to refund any remaining portion of Your pre-paid fees when You cancel such the Services.
        
        You agree to pay Your account balance when due. You also agree to pay any taxes, including sales, use, value added or other similar taxes, resulting from Your use of the Services. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, that VistaPrint may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from You. This Section 10 shall in no way limit any other remedies available to VistaPrint at law or in equity. You also acknowledge and agree that You will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if Your Account is terminated due to Your breach of this Agreement. You must notify VistaPrint of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on Your designated financial account statement. If You do not notify VistaPrint within sixty (60) days, You waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.

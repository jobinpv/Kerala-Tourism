            <p>Kollam is the nerve-centre of the country's cashew trading and processing industry. The cashew industry in Kollam boasts of a legacy of a century of cashew nut export. It was in 1920 	that the first batch of cashews was exported from the country, from Kollam to the USA. History has it that it was in the same year that the first factory was set up in Kollam to start the commercial processing of cashew nuts. What began as a small scale industry grew in leaps and bounds and Kollam is now a major trade centre for cashew in the country. </p>
